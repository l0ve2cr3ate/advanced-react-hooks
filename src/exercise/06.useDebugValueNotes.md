# useDebugValue: useMedia Notes
`useDebugValue` can be used to label your custom hooks (in the DevTools):

```javascript
function useCount({initialCount = 0, step = 1} = {}) {
    React.useDebugValue({initialCount, step})
    const [count, setCount] = React.useState(0)
    const increment = () => setCount(c => c + 1)

    return [count, increment]
}
```

When `useCount` hooks is used, you can see initialCount and step values in React DevTools. You can use it to label your custom hooks, so they are easier to inspect in the React DevTools. 
`useDebugValue` has an optional second argument: a formatter function. This is useful if computing the debug value is computatively expensive, and you therefor only want it to be calculated when the DevTools are open, not when users are using your app.
