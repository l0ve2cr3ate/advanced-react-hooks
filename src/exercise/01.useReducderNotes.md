# Notes useReducer: simple counter

useReducer can be used to separate state logic from components, and keep multiple elements of state that change together, together in a state object.
A reducer is called with two arguments:

1. current state
2. action

## Lazy initialization
```javascript
const init = (initialStateFromProps) => ({
    pokemon: null,
    loading: false,
    error: null,
    });

// ...

const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, props.initialState, init);
```
If you pass a third argument to useReducer, it passes the second argument to that function and uses the returned value for initial state. This can be useful if init function reads into localStorage, or does something else you don't want to happen every re-render.
