# useLayoutEffect: auto-scrolling textarea Notes
There are two ways to tell react to run side-effects:
1. useEffect
2. useLayoutEffect

99% of the time `useEffect` is what you want. `useEffect` runs **after** React renders your component, and ensures your effect callback does not block browser painting. If your effect is mutating the DOM (via a DOM node ref) **and** the DOM mutation will change the appearance of the DOM node between the time that it is rendered and your effect mutates it, you **don't** want to use `useEffect`, but `useLayoutEffect`. This prevents a flicker when your DOM mutations take effect.
`useLayoutEffect` run synchronously immediately after React has performed all DOM mutations. It is usefull when you need to take DOM measurements (like getting scroll position) and then make DOM mutations **or** trigger a synchronous re-render by updating state. Your code will run immediately after the DOM has been updated, but before the browser had a chance to paint thos changes.
