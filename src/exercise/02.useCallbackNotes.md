# Notes useCallback: custom hooks
The *dependency list*  of `useEffect` lets React know  whether to call your callback. If you don't provide a dependency list, React will call your callback every render. But what if you would use a function in your callback? Putting the function in the dependency list, would not help, because the function is defined in the component function body, and re-initializes every render, so your callback will be called every render. `useCallback` solves this problem. If the elements in the dependency list are not changed, useCallback will return the callback from the previous render (so the callback will remain the same between renders). A new function is still created every render, but `useCallback` will return a new one only if elements in the dependency list have changed.

Arguments of `useCallback`:
1. callback itself
2. array of dependencies
