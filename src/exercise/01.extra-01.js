// useReducer: simple Counter

// 1. ðŸ’¯ accept the step as the action
// I want to change things a bit to have this API:

// const [count, changeCount] = React.useReducer(countReducer, initialCount)
// const increment = () => changeCount(step)
// How would you need to change your reducer to make this work?

// This one is just to show that you can pass anything as the action.

  return <button onClick={increment}>{count}</button>
}

export default App
